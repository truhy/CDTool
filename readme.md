# CDTool v1.2b21

## Overview

A Windows CD reading and burning program that I wrote around 2008.
It is able to read and burn sectors to a CD-R or CD-RW.

Notable features:
- It supports writing in RAW DAO 2448 (2048+96) mode, meaning we can supply all of the sectors to be burnt, right from the start of the lead-in, all the way up to the end of the lead-out.
With other burning modes, certain parts, e.g. lead-in, 1st pregap or postgap and lead-out are generated by the burner itself.  It generates these sectors using the TOC that you send before burning.
- With certain drives, e.g. Lite-On ones, it is able to skip (unburnt) areas during the burn

The source code is written in Borland Delphi 7.
